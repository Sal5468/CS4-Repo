Understand
express.static(root, [options])
root - specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

It is an express built in middleware function.

Example might be

app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.static('files'));

The above will first look in dir 'public' then 'files'.
=======================
To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system) 
for files that are served by the express.static function, specify a mount path for the 
static directory as shown below.

app.use('/static',express.static('images'));

Now you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /static path prefix.
